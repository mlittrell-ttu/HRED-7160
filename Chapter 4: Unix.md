# Unix in data science
The free and open source version of Unix for personal computers is called Linux. It has many light-weight and easy to use tools for analyzing and organizing data that could be useful to you in your data science work.
## Accessing Linux 
### Mac
If you are on a Mac you can access BASH (Born Again Shell) by typing:
`command+space` and then searching for `terminal`.
### PC
If you are on a PC accessing bash is a bit more challenging but certainly achievable.
