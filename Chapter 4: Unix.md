# Unix in data science
The free and open source version of Unix for personal computers is called Linux. It has many light-weight and easy to use tools for analyzing and organizing data that could be useful to you in your data science work.
## Accessing Linux 
### Mac
If you are on a Mac you can access BASH (Born Again Shell) by typing:
`command+space` and then searching for `terminal`.
### PC
If you are on a PC accessing bash is a bit more challenging but certainly achievable. I found the instructions in the text to be inadequate so [I created my own here](https://tennesseetechuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mlittrell_tntech_edu/EW-ikoZA5zVLvd3ueLH-TOoBl5SIqtIwn2AZeZJUxtH6kQ?e=cqpPZS). An important note: You will need Admin Access to your PC to be able to follow these instructions.
